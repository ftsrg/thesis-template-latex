\textbf{STUDENT DECLARATION}\\
\end{center}

I, \emph{\vikszerzoKeresztnev{} \vikszerzoVezeteknev}, the undersigned, hereby declare that the present \vikdoktipus{} work has been prepared by myself and without any unauthorized help or assistance. Only the specified sources (references, tools, etc.) were used. All parts taken from other sources word by word, or after rephrasing but with identical meaning, were unambiguously identified with explicit reference to the sources utilized. In the Appendix, I have clearly indicated whether I used artificial intelligence tools in preparing the thesis; if so, I have specified the manner and extent of their use in the table. I acknowledge that I bear full responsibility for any content generated by artificial intelligence -- regardless of the extent of its use.

I agree that the basic information of my present work (author(s), title, abstracts in English and in a second language, year of preparation, name of advisor(s)) will be made publicly available on the internet by BME VIK, and the full text of the work will be available to persons registered in the BME Directory. I declare that the submitted hardcopy of the thesis work and its electronic version are identical. 

Full text of thesis works classified upon the decision of the Dean will be published after a period of three years.
